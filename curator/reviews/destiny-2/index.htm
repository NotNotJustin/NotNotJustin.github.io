                <p>Let's just start off this review by saying, this one's going to be long. I have to do a full game review on <em>all</em> of D2 including the DLCs that you currently have to pay for. I will be judging the DLCs on a different scale, so you may see fluctuations in ratings. Well, let's hop right into it!</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>Base Game - Destiny 2</h4>
                <p>As most of you already know, Activision finally gave up the publishing rights to the Destiny franchise that they capitalized for so long. On October 1st, 2019, the second installment in the Destiny franchise became free-to-play as well as switched over to the Steam store. Players who started playing on or after that date are considered 'New Lights', which most of the veteran players tend to look down upon. I, myself, am a New Light and I've found nothing but kindness and respect in the Destiny community. This is mainly because I am somewhat a vet myself, having played Destiny 1 for a little while and I learned how to boost my Light while I played. Other New Lights, on the other hand, may not feel the same respect I do, or they're just involving themselves with a group of players who have the 'high-and-mighty' mindset, as I like to call it.</p>
                <p />
                <p>If you intend on playing Destiny 2 and are coming on brand new, I recommend finding yourself a nice, casual clan for PvE to start out with, then start boosting your Power Level by gaining access to Exotic weapons, questlines and armor. Exotic weapons, if you didn't know already, are the most powerful weapons in the game, so they shouldn't have a problem, depending on which one you pick, in PvP modes like Crucible and Gambit Prime. You can only equip one Exotic weapon and one Exotic armor peice at a time. This is to balance out the game and make it so you are not completely overpowered in those PvP modes. Below you can find a picture of my current setup on my main character.</p>

                <p><em>Example of a Power 950+ character. (Taken from <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/254/22004459/NNJ">NNJ's Bungie.net Profile.</a>)</em></p>
                <p />
                <p>I've been playing since the third day the game was released on Steam and I've been grinding nonstop since then. Great game.</p>
                <p id="starRating"></p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>Forsaken - Destiny 2</h4>
                <p>Honestly, if we're talking Forsaken, there's not much I can personally talk about, as I have not completed the campaign. I would have completed it already, but to do so, you have to complete 5 Bounties from the Spider on The Tangled Shore before progressing past the second mission. As far as I can tell, Spider only has 4 bounties per day which, if you don't want to do all 4 of them in one go, become pretty redundant. These bounties can take you anywhere in the Shore, hunting down wanted enemies, or just going on a killing spree, which is needed for some Exotic questlines anyway. So if enjoy the Spider's Bounties, go for it, buy the DLC. If you don't want to do that much RNG, just get it for the Exotics. Some are very strong and can easily be obtained from <a href="https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Xûr">X&#251;r</a> or other vendors. Last X&#251;r reset, I got the all the exotics I could from him, including the Wardcliff Coil &amp; One-Eyed Mask, because I'm not lucky enough to get an open-world Exotic Engram.</p>
                <p />
                <p>Overall, what I'm summarizing the Forsaken review up to is this; If you don't get Forsaken for the gameplay, get it for the Exotics. It's definitely worth the $35!</p>
                <p id="starRating"></p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>Shadowkeep Digital Deluxe Edition - Destiny 2</h4>
                <p>Okay, Shadowkeep. Now how do I put this? Shadowkeep is a great DLC if you get it for exotics. People I've talked to have said The Moon in Destiny 2 is just a retexturing and resurfacing from Destiny 1. To put it into perspective, it's the Black Ops 4 of Destiny DLCs. Just ran through a recycling plant and came out as something very, very similar. No hate for Bungie or anything, but I think their development team could've done a little more with this one. Don't get me wrong, as someone who never played Destiny 1's DLCs, I enjoyed Shadowkeep and I have a little more to do before completing the campaign, but as I stated before, it's recycled. Yes, I understand their sugar daddy, Activision is out of the picture now. And sure, they need to make money somehow, but recycling a DLC from an earlier game is not the way to go. You <em>will</em> lose veteran players and you <em>will</em> lose a lot of money since most of their money comes from microtransactions and DLC purchases. Bungie is a game developer I do not want to see go into bankruptcy. I've never met anyone from there, but I imagine they're very good people just trying to bring joy into our hearts.</p>
                <p />
                <p>No matter how I feel about the <em>people,</em> I have to judge the gameplay and this is my verdict:</p>
                <p id="starRating"></p>
                <p><em>...for a lack of content.</em></p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>Season of Dawn - Destiny 2</h4>
                <p>Season of Dawn has absolutely nothing to do with the main Shadowkeep campaign, so I've decided to review this one as its own thing.</p>
                <p>Season of the "I'm Dying", as last season was dubbed by popular Destiny 2 YouTuber/Memer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgz0ObTz3EP2zqilHpv7Arw">Hush</a>, is now officially over and the Season of Dawn is upon us. Season of Dawn has brought back Osiris, the disgraced Warlock, Saint-14, the Legendary Titan, and now has brought back The Dawning. Along with the people and that event came the Sundial Seasonal Activity that players with the Season Pass could complete to get "Timelost Weapons" and the new Seasonal Artifact, the Lantern of Osiris.</p>
                <p />
                <p><em>Thinks to self, "Gosh, now it feels like I'm writing an article for a gaming blog, doesn't it?"</em></p>
                <p />
                <p>Enough with the blogging, into the review...</p>
                <p />
                <h6>Finally! The Review!</h6>
                <p>Timelost Weapons are a thing, bringing some old weapons back and giving us some new ones, like my personal favorite, the Steelfeather Repeater. Maybe it's cause I like high RPM on weapons, or it's because it can get Osmosis, but Steelfeather Repeater is staying in my inventory for a long while!</p>
                <img src="steelfeather.png" alt="NNJ's Roll of Steelfeather Repeater" title="NNJ's Osmosis/Graverobber Steelfeather Repeater" width="750" />
                <p><em>NNJ's Osmosis/Graverobber Steelfeather Repeater</em></p>
                <p />
                <p />
                <p>Overall, I think this season's got to be the best one yet, but there are many more to come, so we'll have to see. Won't we?</p>
                <p />
                <p><em>Great Season means great rating!</em></p>

                <br>
                <h4>Season of the Worthy - Destiny 2</h4>
                <p>Just like with Season of Dawn, Season of the Worthy has nothing to do with the main Shadowkeep campaign, hence why I'm doing this section of the review.</p>
                <p>Season of the Worthy didn't start off great, given players, yet again, a reason to grind bounties, and, yes, once again talk to Rasputin, the Warmind of the expansion, Warmind. Though the season didn't start off well, in my opinion, I've seen more players on than I have in a while, so that's a plus. Also, with this new Season, there's a new Max Power Cap. That being, power level 1000 for soft-cap &amp; 1010 for hard-cap. The grind for soft cap is ruthless, while hard-cap has you doing a constant rotation of Pinnacle activities, like Dungeons and Raids, maybe even Iron Banner, even so it, in and of itself, is a hard thing to do, seeing as how Pinnacle gear can only be 2 power levels above your base.</p>
                <img src="nnj-hunter-1000.png" alt="Justin's Power Level 1000 Character" width="750" title="Justin's Power Level 1000 Character. (Taken from NNJ's Bungine.net Profile)" />
                <p><em>Justin's Power Level 1000 Character. (Taken from <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/254/22004459/NNJ">NNJ's Bungine.net Profile.</a>)</em></p>
                <p />
                <p>In my opinion, as I'm already PL 1000 with two 1002 Armor pieces and a 1001 Hammerhead Machine Gun, It's really worth it to go for the Pinnacle Items, especially since Trials of Osiris is back. Yes, Trials is back! The only thing is, even though it was enabled for the first week, the seasonal Artifact has been disabled for the remainder of the season in Power Level-based activities, such as Iron Banner or Trials of Osiris. Needless to say, I started playing trials with a really sweaty team when I was sitting at 970 Light, but they all quit and moved on because we lost all our games, and they were almost soft-cap! So it's pointless to play Trials unless you're looking to get really angry, or you can out-sweat the other team, which are probably all shotgun users with a Sniper Rifle.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>Season of Arrivals - Destiny 2</h4>
                <p>Season of Arrivals was an introduction to the Darkness, also known as The Veil, and Destiny 2: Beyond Light. It was extended until 10 November from its original end date due to the Beyond Light Development Team needing more time to get the expansion ready to ship.</p>
                <p />
                <p>Even though Season of Arrivals was extended and Beyond Light was delayed, it gave players an opportunity that hasn't been seen in D2 before; The chance to grind out their power level and additional chance to prep for Beyond Light. As you might already be able to tell, there's going to be numerous mentions of Beyond Light throughout this review, so bear with me. Season of Arrivals, or SoA abbreviated, brought a lot of new and returning features to the table. For example, the ability to customize your loot returned from Season of Opulence in the form of Umbral Engrams, Trials returned, and we got a brand new Public Event on Io and Titan that changed location each week called "Contact".</p>
                <p />
                <p>Along with the return of Trials, the Power Level Cap was raised, too, with the softcap being 1000, the hardcap 1050, and the Pinnacle cap 1060. This addition brought about Weapon and Armor Sunsetting which, if you ask me, was totally unnecessary on the Armor side, but needed on the Weapon side. The reason it was needed on the Weapons was because the meta had been the same since the Season of the Black Armory: Mountaintop, Recluse, Anarchy. Those 3 weapons in tandem would be known as the "Toxic Streamer Combo" by some of my friends and part of the Destiny community. And while Anarchy is still a great choice for DPS, The Mountaintop and The Recluse were sunset in Season 12. Rest in Peace Toxic Streamer Combo.</p>
                <p />
                <em><p>Overall, this season was OK. PvP was insane and PvE had a lot of content.</p></em>
                <p id="starRating"></p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4 id="BL">Beyond Light Digital Deluxe Edition - Destiny 2</h4>
                <p><em>Where to begin with this? Hmm... Oh yeah!</em> If you can look past half the game's content being removed, the world loot pool being really dry, and a lot of weapons being rereleased, then you should really enjoy Beyond Light. I mean, it's not all bad. We got back they Seventh Seraph weapons from Season of the Worthy, we got a whole new subclass, and we got to talk to a giant Exo head so we can get a chainsaw sword. All joking aside, if you paid for the Year 1 expansions, you're probably more pissed off now than at the start of Shadowkeep, when the Year 1 expansions became free. Half the game's content was removed and put in the Destiny Content Vault, or DCV, and the only thing that remains of Forsaken's seasonal content is the Blind Well. Forges are gone, all the raids and activities on the Leviathan are gone, the damn Leviathan is gone. Hmm... Maybe this expansion isn't all it's cracked up to be after all.</p>
                <p />
                <p>If we look on the bright side of things, we can see that, one, we got a brand new raid, two, we got the Prophecy dungeon back, and three, we got Empire Hunts(?). The only good thing about Empire Hunts, though, is the ability to get lots of enhancement materials and a really nice Exotic DPS-dealing Sniper Rifle called Cloudstrike, both of which a RNG drops. I mean the thing literally summons an Arc lightning storm, who doesn't love that? And, when you get the Deluxe Edition and complete the campaign, there's a nice, new Exotic No Time To Explain, catalyst, and Ornament waiting for you with the Exo Stranger in Beyond. I honestly don't see the point of getting the Deluxe Edition just for the No Time To Explain, though. The gun's going to be added to the Exotic engram's loot table in Season 14.</p>
                <p />
                <p>And as for the campaign being replayable, I think the campaign was a lame excuse just for Bungie to give you a new subclass, so replayability is almost non-existant. If you think about it, Shadowkeep launched with a weekly replayable mission after you beat the campaign. Beyond Light only lets you replay the missions you do to get The Lament Exotic sword and the Salvation's Grip Exotic Stasis grenade launcher. If you ask me, it's not worth spending $70. If you want all the Seasonal content without having to spend $10 each season, you may want to get the Deluxe Edition, despite the campaign having minimal content. (Ah, yes. The big C-word.)</p>
                <em><p>For the major lack in content and replayability...</p></em>
